This final draft of my visual argument has to do with beauty, specifically black women.
All of the comments on my argument about the girl's hair I have either heard or had said to me.
A year ago I cut off all of my hair because it was so damaged from me straightening it because I wanted to be accepted.
It's okay to wear your hair natural and it's okay to wear your hair straight as long as it's what you want to do.
At the end of the day it's your life and you're beautiful no matter how you wear your hair.
As for editing, I may change the background to dark with light words because that may draw in more attention to the viewer. 
I see this on a billboard somewhere, so what design will make people stop and read is what I need to figure out.
